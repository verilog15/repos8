Mr. Kolomoisky’s bail was set at nearly $14 million, which his lawyers said he would not pay, adding that they would appeal the ruling, according toUkrainian news media.Mr. Kolomoisky’s arrest came a day before President Volodymyr Zelensky said he wasreplacing his defense minister, Oleksii Reznikov, as the Defense Ministry faces investigations into the mishandling of military contracts. Mr. Reznikov has not been personally implicated in the inquiries.Ukraine has beenstepping up its efforts to combat corruptionas it tries to assuage concerns among Western allies that wartime aid could be siphoned off for personal gain. The anti-graft efforts are also part of Ukraine’s case forcloser integration with — and ultimately membership in — the European Union.With a fortune of $1.67 billion, Mr. Kolomoisky was ranked Ukraine’s fifth-richest person in a recentreportby the Kyiv-based Center for Economic Strategy. His business interests have included oil and banking, and he was once considered a patron of Mr. Zelensky, a former comedian whose popular shows were broadcast on Mr. Kolomoisky’s television channel before he successfully ran for the presidency.Suspicions of corruption and embezzlement have dogged Mr. Kolomoisky for years. In 2017, he left Ukraine for Switzerland and Israel after the government of then-President Petro O. Poroshenko seized a bank he co-owned and accused him of a large-scale fraud that threatened to destabilize Ukraine’s economy.He returned in 2019 after Mr. Zelensky’s defeat of Mr. Poroshenko, raising fears that his ties to the new president wouldhelp him regain his economic and political clout.But efforts by the government — including Mr. Zelensky, who campaigned on fighting corruption and the oligarchs’ malign influence — have impeded Mr. Kolomoisky’s ability to assert himself. In 2020, Ukraine’s Parliament passed ananti-corruption billthat prohibits the state from returning nationalized banks to their former owners, which seemed to take direct aim at Mr. Kolomoisky.A year later,the United States placed sanctions on Mr. Kolomoisky,sayinghe had used a position as a regional governor for his personal benefit and engaged in “ongoing efforts to undermine Ukraine’s democratic processes and institutions.”Russia’s full-scale invasion last year further affected Mr. Kolomoisky’s interests. Shortly after the war began, Russian forces destroyed an oil refinery in Kremenchuk that was controlled by one of his companies. This year, the Ukrainian government nationalized that oil company and another connected to him, citing what it described as a need to secure key supplies.On Sunday, after Mr. Kolomoisky was placed in pretrial detention, Ukraine’s state security service said in astatementthat Mr. Kolomoisky had laundered more than half a billion Ukrainian hryvnias, or about $14 million, by transferring funds abroad between 2013 and 2020 through banks under his control.Despite efforts to crack down on corruption, Mr. Zelensky’s administration has continued to be plagued by scandals, including in theprocurement of food for the military. Just last month, Mr. Zelensky ordered the dismissal ofthe directors of the country’s regional recruiting centers, citing accusations that officers were enriching themselves through draft evasion schemes.In an apparent reference to Mr. Kolomoisky’s case, Mr. Zelensky in hisnightly addresson Saturday thanked the police “for their determination to bring every case stalled for decades to a just conclusion.”Show more\n\n\n"},{"Text":"### Graft in Ukraine Military Spending Becomes a Headache\nBut, overall, Ms. Radina, a member of Mr. Zelensky’s governing Servant of the People party, defended the government’s efforts to fend off graft in wartime.The arrest this past weekend of Ihor Kolomoisky, one of Ukraine’s richest men, was seen as a sign of the drive to curb oligarchs’ political influence. Suspected of fraud and money laundering, Mr. Kolomoisky supported Mr. Zelensky’s 2019 election campaign, but since the war began, the president has appeared to break all ties with him.In other crackdowns this year, investigators pursued one of their highest-profile prosecutions ever for bribery, against the chief of Ukraine’s Supreme Court, who wasousted and arrestedin May. In addition, a deputy economy minister is on trial, accused of embezzling from humanitarian aid funds.That high-level cases of corruption are coming to light is positive, said Andrii Borovyk, director of Transparency International in Ukraine, rather than an indication of a nation bogged down by insider dealing; it shows that the country can fight the war and graft at the same time, he said.“Scandals are good,” he said. “The war,” Mr. Borovyk added, “cannot be an excuse to stop fighting corruption.”\n\n\n"},{"Text":"### Xi Jinping of China Looks Set to Skip G20 in Snub to India\nWith a meeting in New Delhi seemingly off the table, Mr. Biden’s next chance to meet with Mr. Xi may not be until November at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in San Francisco. There’s no guarantee that Mr. Xi will attend that meeting either, however, with more indications that China was playing hard to get.In a post published Monday on its WeChat account, China’s Ministry of State Security said the United States needed to “show sufficient sincerity” to justify Mr. Xi’s attendance in San Francisco.Shi Yinhong, an international relations professor at Renmin University in Beijing, said the WeChat post was highly unusual. The ministry, he said, did not have the “authority” to weigh in on China-U.S. relations in such a way because it was “not responsible for diplomacy.”Still, the post reflected the deep skepticism in China about U.S. intentions despite a series of high-level talks in Beijing during the past three months between senior American and Chinese officials. China says the United States can’t claim to want to stabilize relations when it continues to antagonize Beijing by widening trade restrictions, strengthening security alliances with Asian partners and offering support to Taiwan, a self-governed island claimed by China.In India, Mr. Xi’s absence from the G20 summit will be widely viewed as a snub to that country’s leader, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is counting on the summit to burnish his own credentials as a global leader.\n\n\n"},{"Text":"### Rishi Sunak’s Conservative Party Embraces Divisive Issues in U.K.\n“It’s part of their strategy to provoke outrage,” said Tom Burke, a onetime government adviser who is the chairman of E3G, an environmental think tank. “You provoke outrage to reassure your base. It’s exactly the strategy Trump is pursuing in the U.S.”“You’re also,” he said, “setting a trap for Labour.”In the case of climate policy, Mr. Burke said the opposition party had walked into the trap. A messy internal squabble over the low-emission zone broke out between Mr. Khan and the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, after Labour lost a by-election — a special election for a vacant parliamentary seat — in the London suburb of Uxbridge in July. The Conservatives turned the mayor’s plan into a weapon against Labour, pointing out that it would penalize owners of older, more polluting vehicles.Emboldened by the Uxbridge victory, the Conservatives set out to paint Labour as the enemy of car owners everywhere. Mr. Sunak ordered a review of what he called “anti-motorist” policies across Britain; an out-of-touch Labour Party, he said, did not know how much people needed their cars. The Mail on Sunday, a pro-Tory tabloid, claimed that Mr. Khan had a secret plan to create a “carless society.”Still, exploiting so-called wedge issues carries equal risks for the Conservatives. Far-reaching climate policies enjoy broad support in Britain, even among some right-wing voters who view protecting the country’s natural heritage as an inherently conservative instinct. In appeasing a narrow slice of its base, experts said, the party risked turning off swing voters and environmentally conscious supporters in the south.\n\n\n"},{"Text":"### In Spain, Illegal Pot Farms Are Being Blamed for Blackouts\nEndesa, for instance, says that a typical indoor farm in northern Granada — which averages 215 square feet, according to the police — consumes about 20,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per month, roughly 80 times the average consumption of a Spanish household.But Daniel Gómez Lorente, a civil engineering professor at the University of Granada, said this figure seemed “quite exaggerated.” Based on his own rough calculations of what a typical farm would need to run, he estimated that it would consume only a quarter as much electricity as Endesa asserted.Rosario García, the head of a local residents’ association, said that marijuana farms were an “easy excuse” not to address more structural causes for the blackouts. She pointed out that blackouts had been going on for more than a decade but that the marijuana issue had arisen within the past five years.Instead, Ms. García blamed what she said was deficient electrical infrastructure. Several burned-out electrical boxes are visible in the neighborhood, with a tangle of wires dangling over them.Mr. Revuelta argues that Endesa has tried hard to fix those problems, investing more than 8 million euros, about $8.75 million, in the area’s infrastructure over the past three years, making it “the most renewed” in Granada.\n\n\n"},{"Text":"### Johan Floderus, E.U. Official From Sweden, Is Imprisoned in Iran\nGovernments handling negotiations with the Iranian authorities often push for secrecy while they work out what to do, in part to avoid public scrutiny and pressures. Critics say the secrecy also allows them to pursue other policy priorities in talks with Iran without being held accountable.After the New York Times’s article about Mr. Floderus’s incarceration was published Monday morning, the European Parliament deputies who normally scrutinize the E.U.’s Iran policies expressed outrage that the case had been kept secret, shielding the authorities handling it from scrutiny.“The imprisonment of a Swedish citizen and employee of the European Union is a scandalous event that urgently needs to be clarified,” said the Parliament’s Iran delegation chairwoman, Cornelia Ernst. “The commission, and in particular Josep Borrell, must now explain how long they knew about the detention and why it was not made public,” she added, referring to the E.U.’s chief diplomat.Mr. Ratcliffe said, “In our family’s experience, publicity keeps hostages safe because it limits the abuse that gets done to them, and it alerts everyone to the games being played.” He continued, “When Western governments try to suppress these cases and keep families quiet, they are prioritizing other agendas than the welfare of their citizens,” he said.The European Union is pursuing talks to revitalize a nuclear deal with Iran, with a goal of limiting Tehran’s advances in enriching uranium to a level very close to bomb grade.\n\n\n"},{"Text":"### Music Videos Promote Niger’s Military After a Coup\nOn July 26, as a military coup was underway in the West African nation of Niger, the airwaves of Télé Sahel, the state television station, filled with upbeat music videos praising the military. Some of these videos had been circulating for years, but since a group of generals toppled thedemocratically elected presidentin July, Niger has witnessed arevival of both old and new military propaganda, now remixed for theTikTok era.In interviews, a dozen artists, academics and entertainment executives plugged into the Nigerien music scene said that what could be seen as a paradox in the West — an outpouring of new videos and music under military rule — made sense in a country with a long history of griot culture, where storytellers and keepers of oral history praised figures of authority. Fear and respect toward the military are also deeply entrenched within the society, analysts said.It is not clear how many Nigeriens support the military takeover. But the widespread appeal of these songs and videos provides a window into the layered history and sentiments that exist between Nigeriens and the military, which has been omnipresent in the country’s political life through five coups in 50 years and, lately, a struggle with Islamist insurgencies.They also shed light on why many in Niger have in part welcomed the end of democratic rule that they associated with endemic corruption, economic hardship and limited freedom of expression, including for artists.Drums of war and the silence of censorshipAs thousands of people took to the streets of the capital, Niamey, in early August in support of the new junta Souleymane and Zabeirou Barké, two brothers, joined the crowds to shoot their latest music video.Among throngs of men assembled in front of the country’s national assembly, the green and orange Nigerien flags, raised fists and defiant messages against Western countries provided an ideal backdrop for their new song, “Niger Guida,” or “Niger My Home” in the Hausa language.Thethreat of a military interventionby a bloc of West African countries has only strengthened the resolve of young Nigeriens to defend their country and prompted some artists to denounce the threats in scathing songs.“Niger is our home, whoever tries to attack us will face the consequences,” the Barké brothers, who are in their 30s and make up the popular rap group MDM, say in the song, which has been broadcast on Télé-Sahel. “We are not afraid of death, come and kill us.”\n\n\n"},{"Text":"### Parisian Pools, Up Close and Personal\nSo when I moved to Paris last August, I quickly developed a to-visit list of public pools across the city, many dating from the 1930s, during the height of the Art Deco architectural craze. They’re stunning.Take the Piscine des Amiraux, built in 1930 on the city’s working-class northern edge.It’s a long, thin pool, with walls covered in white subway tiles. Look up, and you see a skylight roof, above two rings of balconies lined with the green doors of individual changing rooms. You hang your stuff on anchor-shaped hooks, and when you are done swimming, a cabin boy comes and opens the door for you.It all feels like swimming back through time.But even the more modern pools offer touches of beauty that seem luxurious to a North American eye raised on functionality.Most have huge windows, letting natural light pour in. Many open onto lush gardens. I was so taken with two trees spilling lush pink blooms down one side of the Jean Taris pool that I didn’t notice the dome of the Panthéon rising behind them until the lifeguard, helping me identify the trees, pointed it out. (Crepe myrtle, by the way.)\n\n\n"},{"Text":"### Turkey’s Women’s Volleyball Team Inspires Pride\nAs the volleyball game neared its end, thousands of fans watching on giant screens in an Istanbul park rose to their feet and fell silent. The ball soared, a Turkish player set it up near the net, and her teammate spiked it. Her Italian opponents blocked the shot but knocked the ball out of bounds, handing victory to the Turks and causing the crowd to erupt into chants of “Turkey! Turkey! Turkey!”The nail-biter victory on Friday by Turkey’s national women’s volleyball team in theWomen’s European Volleyball Championshipwas the most recent conquest by the country’s most successful major sports team, a record that has turned it into a rare source of national pride that holds appeal across the country’s social divides.While some ultraconservatives have attacked the women as an affront to Islamic values, their fans laud them as paragons of female empowerment in a country where many women feel they have yet to achieve social equality. And the team’s successes are a welcome bright spot for Turks struggling with sky-high inflation, political polarization and a slow recovery from devastating earthquakes in February that killed more than 50,000 people.Affectionately referred to as “the Sultans of the Net,” the team won theVolleyball Nations Leaguechampionship in July in Arlington, Texas, and became theworld’s top rated women’s national team, according to FIVB, the sport’s international governing body.\n\n\n"},{"Text":"### How the Khakova Dam Disaster Continues to Devastate Ukraine\nIn Odesa, 90 miles west of where the Dnipro flows into the Black Sea, Vladyslav Balinskyi, an ecologist, walked along the shore, glaring at beachgoers.“Nobody should be swimming,” he said. “They don’t know what’s in that water.”He rattled off pollutants that the flood had dumped into the sea: cadmium, strontium, mercury, lead, pesticides, fertilizers and 150 tons of machine oil used in the hydroelectric plant’s massive gears.Nearly every day he dives to survey the impact on marine life.“Fifty percent of the mussels have already died,” he said.‘All Gone. Nothing. Trash.’Liudmyla Mavrych stood in her living room, clutching a soggy scrapbook. A village clerk, she spent much of her life in the same little house in Afanansiivka, a quiet, pretty hamlet along a Dnipro tributary downriver from the dam.The wallpaper was peeling off her walls. The linoleum was peeling off her counters. Mud was smeared across her floors. The whole house smelled like an old, mildewy rag.\n\n\n"},{"Text":"### In Italy, Rape Cases Seize Attention and Expose Cultural Rifts\nMs. Veltri was referring to the sensation created by another recent case of gang rape in Palermo, which is still under investigation. This summer, seven young men met a 19-year-old woman at a downtown club. According to the police, they persuaded the bartender to pour her several drinks, encouraged her to smoke marijuana and then took her to an isolated warehouse, where they raped her, beat her and filmed the abuse.A frame from security video that appeared in the news media showed them carrying her through the streets, as she could barely walk. Another shot showed them leaving her on the ground as they headed to a nearby deli.Italian newspapers published leaked excerpts alleged to be from the men’s WhatsApp messages and conversations. In one, the night was described as “100 cats on top of a bitch.” In a tapped conversation, one of the rapists reportedly said it was disgusting because it was “too many” on her, but he justified it by saying “flesh is flesh.”Eventually the names and addresses of those accused in the case became public, and their social media accounts were filled with insults. But the same was true of the woman’s Instagram account. In an interview in an Italian newspaper, she spoke of having suicidal thoughts. The authorities eventually took her to a shelter.Hundreds of celebrities as well as regular Italians expressed support for the woman with the hashtag “I am not flesh.” The father of a girl who was raped in 2020 in Rome wrote a letter to the newspaper La Repubblica in which he described the “ordeal of having your dignity broken.”\n\n\n"},{"Text":"### Saudi Dissident’s Brother Is Sentenced to Death for Social Media Posts on Royals\nIn recent years, harsher punishments than ever are being meted out to citizens who criticize their government, even as the accused have become less prominent.After being detained, the younger Mr. al-Ghamdi confessed to holding religious and political beliefs that prosecutors portrayed as grave violations of the kingdom’s broadly worded counterterrorism law, according to the court documents. In the confession attributed to him after his arrest, he acknowledged that he was behind the anonymous social media accounts in question.His lawyer denied the charges and said that his client “loved and was loyal to this nation,” according to the court documents. The lawyer argued that his client had neurological and psychiatric conditions that should void any statements attributed to him.Despite that, a panel of judges sentenced Mr. al-Ghamdi to death, according to a copy of the ruling. The verdict is open to appeal.The Saudi government’s Center for International Communication, which handles inquiries from the international news media, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n"},{"Text":"### New Evidence in 2014 Mass Kidnapping of Students in Iguala, Mexico\nAs the students tried to leave Iguala aboard several buses, police officers under the commanders’ control blocked the streets and shot at them, striking some, including one who remains in a coma. The students were then loaded into patrol cars, vanishing soon after.Several miles away, more police officers stopped another bus of students, used tear gas to get them off, then snatched them away.They, too, were among the 43 who disappeared.The emergency responder on the cartel’s payroll said he got two phone calls that night. One of the police commanders asked him “who he should hand over the ‘packages’” to, referring to the hostages. A cartel assassin also called, asking who was bringing him “the packages,” according to his sworn statement.Exactly what happened next remains a mystery.According to one cartel member whose testimony has become key to the case, some of the students were taken to a house, killed and dismembered. Machete hacks left gashes in the floor, the witness said, and the students’ remains were later burned in the crematory owned by the coroner’s family.The military knew where at least some of students were being taken, because it was spying on a conversation between a police commander and a cartel boss as they talked about where to deposit the hostages, according to documents made public by the Mexican government.\n\n\n"},{"Text":"### Rishi Sunak Accused of Cutting U.K. School Rebuilding in Concrete Crisis\nIn May 2019, the industry’s Standing Committee on Structural Safety warned that planks made from the lightweight concrete that predated 1980 should be replaced. “Although called ‘concrete,’ it is very different from traditional concrete and, because of the way in which it was made, much weaker,” the report said.The Labour Party has seized on these warnings to argue that successive Conservative-led governments failed to prioritize child safety. Warnings about the dangers posed by the material began to emerge in the late 1990s, and became more acute after a school ceiling collapsed in 2018. Even now, however, the education department said it was waiting on questionnaires to be returned from 10 percent of the country’s schools to determine whether they were at risk.Labour’s shadow education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, said the decisions Mr. Sunak made as chancellor had “put children directly at risk from this dangerous form of concrete, which should have been replaced.”In a social media post issued on Sunday, Labour said, “Do you think your child’s school should be safe? Rishi Sunak doesn’t.”The government’s case has not been helped by a report in The Sun, a London tabloid, that the offices of the secretary of education, Gillian Keegan, and her department, were remodeled at a cost of tens of millions of pounds during this period. The contract for the renovation was awarded under Ms. Keegan’s predecessor, The Sun reported.\n\n\n"},{"Text":"### Perilous, Icy Mission Rescues Sick Worker in Antarctica\nThree doctors on board are treating the patient, who had a “developing medical condition and needs specialist assessment and care in Australia” the statement said.

It’s still very much winter in Antarctica.”The rescue operation was only made possible, he said, because of the ship’s ice-breaking and helicopter-carrying capabilities, and the helicopters’ flying ranges.He added that the Australian team had spoken to several international partners about helping with the mission, and had asked the American Antarctica team about the location of their icebreaker, but was ultimately able to accomplish the rescue mission solely with Australian resources.The Casey base, located on the northern side of the Bailey Peninsula on the Budd Coast, is one of Australia’s three Antarctic stations.

They concluded that any such Big Bang must have been hot enough to sustain thermonuclear reactions, at millions of degrees, in order to synthesize heavy elements from primordial hydrogen.That energy should still be around, they realized. But as the universe expanded, the primeval fireball would have cooled to a few kelvin above absolute zero — which, they calculated, would put the cosmic radiation in the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum. (The group did not know, or had forgotten, that the same calculation had been made 20 years earlier by the physicist George Gamow and his collaborators at George Washington University.)Dr. Dicke assigned two graduate students — David Wilkinson, a gifted instrumentalist, and James Peebles, a theorist — to try to detect these microwaves. As the group was meeting to decide on a plan of action, the phone rang. It was Dr. Penzias. When Dr. Dicke hung up, he turned to his team. “Boys, we’ve just been scooped,” he said.The two teams met and wrote a pair of papers, which were published back-to-back in the journal Physical Review Letters. The Bell Labs group described the radio noise, and the Princeton group proposed that it could be leftover heat from the Big Bang — “probably each side thinking, Well, what we’ve done is correct but the other may not be,” Dr. Wilson said.“I think both Arnold and I wanted to leave open the idea that there was some other source of this noise,” he added. “But, of course, that didn’t work out.”\n\n\n"},{"Text":"### Who Is Rustem Umerov, Zelensky’s Nominee for Ukraine’s Defense Minister?\nRussia has persecuted the Crimean Tatars, who are predominantly Muslim, since it illegally annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014, targeting them for arrests, Ukrainian authorities say.

His business interests have included oil and banking, and he was once considered a patron of Mr. Zelensky, a former comedian whose popular shows were broadcast on Mr. Kolomoisky’s television channel before he successfully ran for the presidency.Suspicions of corruption and embezzlement have dogged Mr. Kolomoisky for years. In 2017, he left Ukraine for Switzerland and Israel after the government of then-President Petro O. Poroshenko seized a bank he co-owned and accused him of a large-scale fraud that threatened to destabilize Ukraine’s economy.He returned in 2019 after Mr. Zelensky’s defeat of Mr. Poroshenko, raising fears that his ties to the new president wouldhelp him regain his economic and political clout.But efforts by the government — including Mr. Zelensky, who campaigned on fighting corruption and the oligarchs’ malign influence — have impeded Mr. Kolomoisky’s ability to assert himself. In 2020, Ukraine’s Parliament passed ananti-corruption billthat prohibits the state from returning nationalized banks to their former owners, which seemed to take direct aim at Mr. Kolomoisky.A year later,the United States placed sanctions on Mr. Kolomoisky,sayinghe had used a position as a regional governor for his personal benefit and engaged in “ongoing efforts to undermine Ukraine’s democratic processes and institutions.”Russia’s full-scale invasion last year further affected Mr. Kolomoisky’s interests. Shortly after the war began, Russian forces destroyed an oil refinery in Kremenchuk that was controlled by one of his companies. This year, the Ukrainian government nationalized that oil company and another connected to him, citing what it described as a need to secure key supplies.On Sunday, after Mr. Kolomoisky was placed in pretrial detention, Ukraine’s state security service said in astatementthat Mr. Kolomoisky had laundered more than half a billion Ukrainian hryvnias, or about $14 million, by transferring funds abroad between 2013 and 2020 through banks under his control.Despite efforts to crack down on corruption, Mr. Zelensky’s administration has continued to be plagued by scandals, including in theprocurement of food for the military. Just last month, Mr. Zelensky ordered the dismissal ofthe directors of the country’s regional recruiting centers, citing accusations that officers were enriching themselves through draft evasion schemes.In an apparent reference to Mr. Kolomoisky’s case, Mr. Zelensky in hisnightly addresson Saturday thanked the police “for their determination to bring every case stalled for decades to a just conclusion.”Show more\n\n\n"},{"Text":"### Graft in Ukraine Military Spending Becomes a Headache\nBut, overall, Ms. Radina, a member of Mr. Zelensky’s governing Servant of the People party, defended the government’s efforts to fend off graft in wartime.The arrest this past weekend of Ihor Kolomoisky, one of Ukraine’s richest men, was seen as a sign of the drive to curb oligarchs’ political influence. Suspected of fraud and money laundering, Mr. Kolomoisky supported Mr. Zelensky’s 2019 election campaign, but since the war began, the president has appeared to break all ties with him.In other crackdowns this year, investigators pursued one of their highest-profile prosecutions ever for bribery, against the chief of Ukraine’s Supreme Court, who wasousted and arrestedin May. In addition, a deputy economy minister is on trial, accused of embezzling from humanitarian aid funds.That high-level cases of corruption are coming to light is positive, said Andrii Borovyk, director of Transparency International in Ukraine, rather than an indication of a nation bogged down by insider dealing; it shows that the country can fight the war and graft at the same time, he said.“Scandals are good,” he said. “The war,” Mr. Borovyk added, “cannot be an excuse to stop fighting corruption.”\n\n\n"},{"Text":"### Xi Jinping of China Looks Set to Skip G20 in Snub to India\nWith a meeting in New Delhi seemingly off the table, Mr. Biden’s next chance to meet with Mr. Xi may not be until November at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in San Francisco. There’s no guarantee that Mr. Xi will attend that meeting either, however, with more indications that China was playing hard to get.In a post published Monday on its WeChat account, China’s Ministry of State Security said the United States needed to “show sufficient sincerity” to justify Mr. Xi’s attendance in San Francisco.Shi Yinhong, an international relations professor at Renmin University in Beijing, said the WeChat post was highly unusual. The ministry, he said, did not have the “authority” to weigh in on China-U.S. relations in such a way because it was “not responsible for diplomacy.”Still, the post reflected the deep skepticism in China about U.S. intentions despite a series of high-level talks in Beijing during the past three months between senior American and Chinese officials. China says the United States can’t claim to want to stabilize relations when it continues to antagonize Beijing by widening trade restrictions, strengthening security alliances with Asian partners and offering support to Taiwan, a self-governed island claimed by China.In India, Mr. Xi’s absence from the G20 summit will be widely viewed as a snub to that country’s leader, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is counting on the summit to burnish his own credentials as a global leader.\n\n\n"},{"Text":"### Rishi Sunak’s Conservative Party Embraces Divisive Issues in U.K.\n“It’s part of their strategy to provoke outrage,” said Tom Burke, a onetime government adviser who is the chairman of E3G, an environmental think tank. “You provoke outrage to reassure your base. It’s exactly the strategy Trump is pursuing in the U.S.”“You’re also,” he said, “setting a trap for Labour.”In the case of climate policy, Mr. Burke said the opposition party had walked into the trap. A messy internal squabble over the low-emission zone broke out between Mr. Khan and the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, after Labour lost a by-election — a special election for a vacant parliamentary seat — in the London suburb of Uxbridge in July. The Conservatives turned the mayor’s plan into a weapon against Labour, pointing out that it would penalize owners of older, more polluting vehicles.Emboldened by the Uxbridge victory, the Conservatives set out to paint Labour as the enemy of car owners everywhere. Mr. Sunak ordered a review of what he called “anti-motorist” policies across Britain; an out-of-touch Labour Party, he said, did not know how much people needed their cars. The Mail on Sunday, a pro-Tory tabloid, claimed that Mr. Khan had a secret plan to create a “carless society.”Still, exploiting so-called wedge issues carries equal risks for the Conservatives. Far-reaching climate policies enjoy broad support in Britain, even among some right-wing voters who view protecting the country’s natural heritage as an inherently conservative instinct. In appeasing a narrow slice of its base, experts said, the party risked turning off swing voters and environmentally conscious supporters in the south.\n\n\n"},{"Text":"### In Spain, Illegal Pot Farms Are Being Blamed for Blackouts\nEndesa, for instance, says that a typical indoor farm in northern Granada — which averages 215 square feet, according to the police — consumes about 20,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per month, roughly 80 times the average consumption of a Spanish household.But Daniel Gómez Lorente, a civil engineering professor at the University of Granada, said this figure seemed “quite exaggerated.” Based on his own rough calculations of what a typical farm would need to run, he estimated that it would consume only a quarter as much electricity as Endesa asserted.Rosario García, the head of a local residents’ association, said that marijuana farms were an “easy excuse” not to address more structural causes for the blackouts. She pointed out that blackouts had been going on for more than a decade but that the marijuana issue had arisen within the past five years.Instead, Ms. García blamed what she said was deficient electrical infrastructure. Several burned-out electrical boxes are visible in the neighborhood, with a tangle of wires dangling over them.Mr. Revuelta argues that Endesa has tried hard to fix those problems, investing more than 8 million euros, about $8.75 million, in the area’s infrastructure over the past three years, making it “the most renewed” in Granada.\n\n\n"},{"Text":"### Johan Floderus, E.U. Official From Sweden, Is Imprisoned in Iran\nGovernments handling negotiations with the Iranian authorities often push for secrecy while they work out what to do, in part to avoid public scrutiny and pressures. Critics say the secrecy also allows them to pursue other policy priorities in talks with Iran without being held accountable.After the New York Times’s article about Mr. Floderus’s incarceration was published Monday morning, the European Parliament deputies who normally scrutinize the E.U.’s Iran policies expressed outrage that the case had been kept secret, shielding the authorities handling it from scrutiny.“The imprisonment of a Swedish citizen and employee of the European Union is a scandalous event that urgently needs to be clarified,” said the Parliament’s Iran delegation chairwoman, Cornelia Ernst. “The commission, and in particular Josep Borrell, must now explain how long they knew about the detention and why it was not made public,” she added, referring to the E.U.’s chief diplomat.Mr. Ratcliffe said, “In our family’s experience, publicity keeps hostages safe because it limits the abuse that gets done to them, and it alerts everyone to the games being played.” He continued, “When Western governments try to suppress these cases and keep families quiet, they are prioritizing other agendas than the welfare of their citizens,” he said.The European Union is pursuing talks to revitalize a nuclear deal with Iran, with a goal of limiting Tehran’s advances in enriching uranium to a level very close to bomb grade.\n\n\n"},{"Text":"### Music Videos Promote Niger’s Military After a Coup\nOn July 26, as a military coup was underway in the West African nation of Niger, the airwaves of Télé Sahel, the state television station, filled with upbeat music videos praising the military. Some of these videos had been circulating for years, but since a group of generals toppled thedemocratically elected presidentin July, Niger has witnessed arevival of both old and new military propaganda, now remixed for theTikTok era.In interviews, a dozen artists, academics and entertainment executives plugged into the Nigerien music scene said that what could be seen as a paradox in the West — an outpouring of new videos and music under military rule — made sense in a country with a long history of griot culture, where storytellers and keepers of oral history praised figures of authority. Fear and respect toward the military are also deeply entrenched within the society, analysts said.It is not clear how many Nigeriens support the military takeover. But the widespread appeal of these songs and videos provides a window into the layered history and sentiments that exist between Nigeriens and the military, which has been omnipresent in the country’s political life through five coups in 50 years and, lately, a struggle with Islamist insurgencies.They also shed light on why many in Niger have in part welcomed the end of democratic rule that they associated with endemic corruption, economic hardship and limited freedom of expression, including for artists.Drums of war and the silence of censorshipAs thousands of people took to the streets of the capital, Niamey, in early August in support of the new junta Souleymane and Zabeirou Barké, two brothers, joined the crowds to shoot their latest music video.Among throngs of men assembled in front of the country’s national assembly, the green and orange Nigerien flags, raised fists and defiant messages against Western countries provided an ideal backdrop for their new song, “Niger Guida,” or “Niger My Home” in the Hausa language.Thethreat of a military interventionby a bloc of West African countries has only strengthened the resolve of young Nigeriens to defend their country and prompted some artists to denounce the threats in scathing songs.“Niger is our home, whoever tries to attack us will face the consequences,” the Barké brothers, who are in their 30s and make up the popular rap group MDM, say in the song, which has been broadcast on Télé-Sahel. “We are not afraid of death, come and kill us.”\n\n\n"},{"Text":"### Parisian Pools, Up Close and Personal\nSo when I moved to Paris last August, I quickly developed a to-visit list of public pools across the city, many dating from the 1930s, during the height of the Art Deco architectural craze. They’re stunning.Take the Piscine des Amiraux, built in 1930 on the city’s working-class northern edge.It’s a long, thin pool, with walls covered in white subway tiles. Look up, and you see a skylight roof, above two rings of balconies lined with the green doors of individual changing rooms. You hang your stuff on anchor-shaped hooks, and when you are done swimming, a cabin boy comes and opens the door for you.It all feels like swimming back through time.But even the more modern pools offer touches of beauty that seem luxurious to a North American eye raised on functionality.Most have huge windows, letting natural light pour in. Many open onto lush gardens. I was so taken with two trees spilling lush pink blooms down one side of the Jean Taris pool that I didn’t notice the dome of the Panthéon rising behind them until the lifeguard, helping me identify the trees, pointed it out. (Crepe myrtle, by the way.)\n\n\n"},{"Text":"### Turkey’s Women’s Volleyball Team Inspires Pride\nAs the volleyball game neared its end, thousands of fans watching on giant screens in an Istanbul park rose to their feet and fell silent. The ball soared, a Turkish player set it up near the net, and her teammate spiked it. Her Italian opponents blocked the shot but knocked the ball out of bounds, handing victory to the Turks and causing the crowd to erupt into chants of “Turkey! Turkey! Turkey!”The nail-biter victory on Friday by Turkey’s national women’s volleyball team in theWomen’s European Volleyball Championshipwas the most recent conquest by the country’s most successful major sports team, a record that has turned it into a rare source of national pride that holds appeal across the country’s social divides.While some ultraconservatives have attacked the women as an affront to Islamic values, their fans laud them as paragons of female empowerment in a country where many women feel they have yet to achieve social equality. And the team’s successes are a welcome bright spot for Turks struggling with sky-high inflation, political polarization and a slow recovery from devastating earthquakes in February that killed more than 50,000 people.Affectionately referred to as “the Sultans of the Net,” the team won theVolleyball Nations Leaguechampionship in July in Arlington, Texas, and became theworld’s top rated women’s national team, according to FIVB, the sport’s international governing body.\n\n\n"},{"Text":"### How the Khakova Dam Disaster Continues to Devastate Ukraine\nIn Odesa, 90 miles west of where the Dnipro flows into the Black Sea, Vladyslav Balinskyi, an ecologist, walked along the shore, glaring at beachgoers.“Nobody should be swimming,” he said. “They don’t know what’s in that water.”He rattled off pollutants that the flood had dumped into the sea: cadmium, strontium, mercury, lead, pesticides, fertilizers and 150 tons of machine oil used in the hydroelectric plant’s massive gears.Nearly every day he dives to survey the impact on marine life.“Fifty percent of the mussels have already died,” he said.‘All Gone.

This summer, seven young men met a 19-year-old woman at a downtown club. According to the police, they persuaded the bartender to pour her several drinks, encouraged her to smoke marijuana and then took her to an isolated warehouse, where they raped her, beat her and filmed the abuse.A frame from security video that appeared in the news media showed them carrying her through the streets, as she could barely walk. Another shot showed them leaving her on the ground as they headed to a nearby deli.Italian newspapers published leaked excerpts alleged to be from the men’s WhatsApp messages and conversations. In one, the night was described as “100 cats on top of a bitch.” In a tapped conversation, one of the rapists reportedly said it was disgusting because it was “too many” on her, but he justified it by saying “flesh is flesh.”Eventually the names and addresses of those accused in the case became public, and their social media accounts were filled with insults. But the same was true of the woman’s Instagram account. In an interview in an Italian newspaper, she spoke of having suicidal thoughts. The authorities eventually took her to a shelter.Hundreds of celebrities as well as regular Italians expressed support for the woman with the hashtag “I am not flesh.” The father of a girl who was raped in 2020 in Rome wrote a letter to the newspaper La Repubblica in which he described the “ordeal of having your dignity broken.”\n\n\n"},{"Text":"### Saudi Dissident’s Brother Is Sentenced to Death for Social Media Posts on Royals\nIn recent years, harsher punishments than ever are being meted out to citizens who criticize their government, even as the accused have become less prominent.After being detained, the younger Mr. al-Ghamdi confessed to holding religious and political beliefs that prosecutors portrayed as grave violations of the kingdom’s broadly worded counterterrorism law, according to the court documents. In the confession attributed to him after his arrest, he acknowledged that he was behind the anonymous social media accounts in question.His lawyer denied the charges and said that his client “loved and was loyal to this nation,” according to the court documents. The lawyer argued that his client had neurological and psychiatric conditions that should void any statements attributed to him.Despite that, a panel of judges sentenced Mr. al-Ghamdi to death, according to a copy of the ruling.

The students were then loaded into patrol cars, vanishing soon after.Several miles away, more police officers stopped another bus of students, used tear gas to get them off, then snatched them away.They, too, were among the 43 who disappeared.The emergency responder on the cartel’s payroll said he got two phone calls that night. One of the police commanders asked him “who he should hand over the ‘packages’” to, referring to the hostages. A cartel assassin also called, asking who was bringing him “the packages,” according to his sworn statement.Exactly what happened next remains a mystery.According to one cartel member whose testimony has become key to the case, some of the students were taken to a house, killed and dismembered. Machete hacks left gashes in the floor, the witness said, and the students’ remains were later burned in the crematory owned by the coroner’s family.The military knew where at least some of students were being taken, because it was spying on a conversation between a police commander and a cartel boss as they talked about where to deposit the hostages, according to documents made public by the Mexican government.\n\n\n"},{"Text":"### Rishi Sunak Accused of Cutting U.K. School Rebuilding in Concrete Crisis\nIn May 2019, the industry’s Standing Committee on Structural Safety warned that planks made from the lightweight concrete that predated 1980 should be replaced. “Although called ‘concrete,’ it is very different from traditional concrete and, because of the way in which it was made, much weaker,” the report said.The Labour Party has seized on these warnings to argue that successive Conservative-led governments failed to prioritize child safety. Warnings about the dangers posed by the material began to emerge in the late 1990s, and became more acute after a school ceiling collapsed in 2018. Even now, however, the education department said it was waiting on questionnaires to be returned from 10 percent of the country’s schools to determine whether they were at risk.Labour’s shadow education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, said the decisions Mr. Sunak made as chancellor had “put children directly at risk from this dangerous form of concrete, which should have been replaced.”In a social media post issued on Sunday, Labour said, “Do you think your child’s school should be safe? Rishi Sunak doesn’t.”The government’s case has not been helped by a report in The Sun, a London tabloid, that the offices of the secretary of education, Gillian Keegan, and her department, were remodeled at a cost of tens of millions of pounds during this period.

They concluded that any such Big Bang must have been hot enough to sustain thermonuclear reactions, at millions of degrees, in order to synthesize heavy elements from primordial hydrogen.That energy should still be around, they realized. But as the universe expanded, the primeval fireball would have cooled to a few kelvin above absolute zero — which, they calculated, would put the cosmic radiation in the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum. (The group did not know, or had forgotten, that the same calculation had been made 20 years earlier by the physicist George Gamow and his collaborators at George Washington University.)Dr. Dicke assigned two graduate students — David Wilkinson, a gifted instrumentalist, and James Peebles, a theorist — to try to detect these microwaves. As the group was meeting to decide on a plan of action, the phone rang. It was Dr. Penzias. When Dr. Dicke hung up, he turned to his team. “Boys, we’ve just been scooped,” he said.The two teams met and wrote a pair of papers, which were published back-to-back in the journal Physical Review Letters.

Spending Becomes a Headache\nBut, overall, Ms. Radina, a member of Mr. Zelensky’s governing Servant of the People party, defended the government’s efforts to fend off graft in wartime.The arrest this past weekend of Ihor Kolomoisky, one of Ukraine’s richest men, was seen as a sign of the drive to curb oligarchs’ political influence. Suspected of fraud and money laundering, Mr. Kolomoisky supported Mr. Zelensky’s 2019 election campaign, but since the war began, the president has appeared to break all ties with him.In other crackdowns this year, investigators pursued one of their highest-profile prosecutions ever for bribery, against the chief of Ukraine’s Supreme Court, who wasousted and arrestedin May. In addition, a deputy economy minister is on trial, accused of embezzling from humanitarian aid funds.That high-level cases of corruption are coming to light is positive, said Andrii Borovyk, director of Transparency International in Ukraine, rather than an indication of a nation bogged down by insider dealing; it shows that the country can fight the war and graft at the same time, he said.“Scandals are good,” he said. “The war,” Mr. Borovyk added, “cannot be an excuse to stop fighting corruption.”\n\n\n\n### Russia-Ukraine War: No Breakthrough on Grain Deal After Putin and Erdogan Meet\nUkraine steps up anti-corruption efforts with the arrest of a powerful oligarch.The Ukrainian billionaire Ihor Kolomoisky, center, attended a court hearing in Kyiv on Saturday.Credit...Sergei Chuzavkov/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThe arrest over the weekend of Ihor Kolomoisky, one of Ukraine’s richest men, has been seen as a sign of Ukrainian authorities’ drive to root out corruption and curb the influence of oligarchs.A court in Kyiv on Saturday ordered Mr. Kolomoisky held in pretrial detention for two months while authorities investigate fraud and money laundering charges against him. Mr. Kolomoisky’s bail was set at nearly $14 million, which his lawyers said he would not pay, adding that they would appeal the ruling, according toUkrainian news media.Mr. Kolomoisky’s arrest came a day before President Volodymyr Zelensky said he wasreplacing his defense minister, Oleksii Reznikov, as the Defense Ministry faces investigations into the mishandling of military contracts. Mr. Reznikov has not been personally implicated in the inquiries.Ukraine has beenstepping up its efforts to combat corruptionas it tries to assuage concerns among Western allies that wartime aid could be siphoned off for personal gain. The anti-graft efforts are also part of Ukraine’s case forcloser integration with — and ultimately membership in — the European Union.With a fortune of $1.67 billion, Mr. Kolomoisky was ranked Ukraine’s fifth-richest person in a recentreportby the Kyiv-based Center for Economic Strategy. His business interests have included oil and banking, and he was once considered a patron of Mr. Zelensky, a former comedian whose popular shows were broadcast on Mr. Kolomoisky’s television channel before he successfully ran for the presidency.Suspicions of corruption and embezzlement have dogged Mr. Kolomoisky for years. In 2017, he left Ukraine for Switzerland and Israel after the government of then-President Petro O. Poroshenko seized a bank he co-owned and accused him of a large-scale fraud that threatened to destabilize Ukraine’s economy.He returned in 2019 after Mr. Zelensky’s defeat of Mr. Poroshenko, raising fears that his ties to the new president wouldhelp him regain his economic and political clout.But efforts by the government — including Mr. Zelensky, who campaigned on fighting corruption and the oligarchs’ malign influence — have impeded Mr. Kolomoisky’s ability to assert himself. In 2020, Ukraine’s Parliament passed ananti-corruption billthat prohibits the state from returning nationalized banks to their former owners, which seemed to take direct aim at Mr. Kolomoisky.A year later,the United States placed sanctions on Mr. Kolomoisky,sayinghe had used a position as a regional governor for his personal benefit and engaged in “ongoing efforts to undermine Ukraine’s democratic processes and institutions.”Russia’s full-scale invasion last year further affected Mr. Kolomoisky’s interests. Shortly after the war began, Russian forces destroyed an oil refinery in Kremenchuk that was controlled by one of his companies. This year, the Ukrainian government nationalized that oil company and another connected to him, citing what it described as a need to secure key supplies.On Sunday, after Mr. Kolomoisky was placed in pretrial detention, Ukraine’s state security service said in astatementthat Mr. Kolomoisky had laundered more than half a billion Ukrainian hryvnias, or about $14 million, by transferring funds abroad between 2013 and 2020 through banks under his control.Despite efforts to crack down on corruption, Mr. Zelensky’s administration has continued to be plagued by scandals, including in theprocurement of food for the military. Just last month, Mr. Zelensky ordered the dismissal ofthe directors of the country’s regional recruiting centers, citing accusations that officers were enriching themselves through draft evasion schemes.In an apparent reference to Mr. Kolomoisky’s case, Mr. Zelensky in hisnightly addresson Saturday thanked the police “for their determination to bring every case stalled for decades to a just conclusion.”Show more\n\n\n\n"}}}],"width":120.0,"height":120.0},{"instance":{"path":"String/0.1.0","meta":{"name":"String","authors":["Evan Almloff <evanalmloff@gmail.com>"],"description":"Takes a string and returns the string","package_version":"0.1.0","binding_version":"*"},"remote":{"last_fetched":1693796532,"sha":"e10b6d735f98c45ef7c5d2aece00228e5ea593d1","repo":{"owner":"floneum","name":"floneum"},"structure":{"name":"String","authors":["Evan Almloff <evanalmloff@gmail.com>"],"description":"Takes a string and returns the string","package_version":"0.1.0","binding_version":"*"}}},"id":3,"position":[198.0,113.0],"inputs":[{"definition":{"name":" the string","ty":{"Single":"Text"}},"value":[{"Single":{"Text":"Ukraine"}}]}],"outputs":[{"definition":{"name":"output","ty":{"Single":"Text"}},"value":{"Single":{"Text":"Ukraine"}}}],"width":120.0,"height":120.0},{"instance":{"path":"Embedding/0.1.0","meta":{"name":"Embedding","authors":["Evan Almloff <evanalmloff@gmail.com>"],"description":"Creates embeddings for some text.\n\nAn embedding is a representation of something like the \"meaning\" of some text.

Mr. Kolomoisky’s bail was set at nearly $14 million, which his lawyers said he would not pay, adding that they would appeal the ruling, according toUkrainian news media.Mr. Kolomoisky’s arrest came a day before President Volodymyr Zelensky said he wasreplacing his defense minister, Oleksii Reznikov, as the Defense Ministry faces investigations into the mishandling of military contracts. Mr. Reznikov has not been personally implicated in the inquiries.Ukraine has beenstepping up its efforts to combat corruptionas it tries to assuage concerns among Western allies that wartime aid could be siphoned off for personal gain. The anti-graft efforts are also part of Ukraine’s case forcloser integration with — and ultimately membership in — the European Union.With a fortune of $1.67 billion, Mr. Kolomoisky was ranked Ukraine’s fifth-richest person in a recentreportby the Kyiv-based Center for Economic Strategy. His business interests have included oil and banking, and he was once considered a patron of Mr. Zelensky, a former comedian whose popular shows were broadcast on Mr. Kolomoisky’s television channel before he successfully ran for the presidency.Suspicions of corruption and embezzlement have dogged Mr. Kolomoisky for years. In 2017, he left Ukraine for Switzerland and Israel after the government of then-President Petro O. Poroshenko seized a bank he co-owned and accused him of a large-scale fraud that threatened to destabilize Ukraine’s economy.He returned in 2019 after Mr. Zelensky’s defeat of Mr. Poroshenko, raising fears that his ties to the new president wouldhelp him regain his economic and political clout.But efforts by the government — including Mr. Zelensky, who campaigned on fighting corruption and the oligarchs’ malign influence — have impeded Mr. Kolomoisky’s ability to assert himself. In 2020, Ukraine’s Parliament passed ananti-corruption billthat prohibits the state from returning nationalized banks to their former owners, which seemed to take direct aim at Mr. Kolomoisky.A year later,the United States placed sanctions on Mr. Kolomoisky,sayinghe had used a position as a regional governor for his personal benefit and engaged in “ongoing efforts to undermine Ukraine’s democratic processes and institutions.”Russia’s full-scale invasion last year further affected Mr. Kolomoisky’s interests. Shortly after the war began, Russian forces destroyed an oil refinery in Kremenchuk that was controlled by one of his companies. This year, the Ukrainian government nationalized that oil company and another connected to him, citing what it described as a need to secure key supplies.On Sunday, after Mr. Kolomoisky was placed in pretrial detention, Ukraine’s state security service said in astatementthat Mr. Kolomoisky had laundered more than half a billion Ukrainian hryvnias, or about $14 million, by transferring funds abroad between 2013 and 2020 through banks under his control.Despite efforts to crack down on corruption, Mr. Zelensky’s administration has continued to be plagued by scandals, including in theprocurement of food for the military.

Mr. Kolomoisky’s bail was set at nearly $14 million, which his lawyers said he would not pay, adding that they would appeal the ruling, according toUkrainian news media.Mr. Kolomoisky’s arrest came a day before President Volodymyr Zelensky said he wasreplacing his defense minister, Oleksii Reznikov, as the Defense Ministry faces investigations into the mishandling of military contracts. Mr. Reznikov has not been personally implicated in the inquiries.Ukraine has beenstepping up its efforts to combat corruptionas it tries to assuage concerns among Western allies that wartime aid could be siphoned off for personal gain. The anti-graft efforts are also part of Ukraine’s case forcloser integration with — and ultimately membership in — the European Union.With a fortune of $1.67 billion, Mr. Kolomoisky was ranked Ukraine’s fifth-richest person in a recentreportby the Kyiv-based Center for Economic Strategy. His business interests have included oil and banking, and he was once considered a patron of Mr. Zelensky, a former comedian whose popular shows were broadcast on Mr. Kolomoisky’s television channel before he successfully ran for the presidency.Suspicions of corruption and embezzlement have dogged Mr. Kolomoisky for years. In 2017, he left Ukraine for Switzerland and Israel after the government of then-President Petro O. Poroshenko seized a bank he co-owned and accused him of a large-scale fraud that threatened to destabilize Ukraine’s economy.He returned in 2019 after Mr. Zelensky’s defeat of Mr. Poroshenko, raising fears that his ties to the new president wouldhelp him regain his economic and political clout.But efforts by the government — including Mr. Zelensky, who campaigned on fighting corruption and the oligarchs’ malign influence — have impeded Mr. Kolomoisky’s ability to assert himself. In 2020, Ukraine’s Parliament passed ananti-corruption billthat prohibits the state from returning nationalized banks to their former owners, which seemed to take direct aim at Mr. Kolomoisky.A year later,the United States placed sanctions on Mr. Kolomoisky,sayinghe had used a position as a regional governor for his personal benefit and engaged in “ongoing efforts to undermine Ukraine’s democratic processes and institutions.”Russia’s full-scale invasion last year further affected Mr. Kolomoisky’s interests. Shortly after the war began, Russian forces destroyed an oil refinery in Kremenchuk that was controlled by one of his companies. This year, the Ukrainian government nationalized that oil company and another connected to him, citing what it described as a need to secure key supplies.On Sunday, after Mr. Kolomoisky was placed in pretrial detention, Ukraine’s state security service said in astatementthat Mr. Kolomoisky had laundered more than half a billion Ukrainian hryvnias, or about $14 million, by transferring funds abroad between 2013 and 2020 through banks under his control.Despite efforts to crack down on corruption, Mr. Zelensky’s administration has continued to be plagued by scandals, including in theprocurement of food for the military. Just last month, Mr. Zelensky ordered the dismissal ofthe directors of the country’s regional recruiting centers, citing accusations that officers were enriching themselves through draft evasion schemes.In an apparent reference to Mr. Kolomoisky’s case, Mr. Zelensky in hisnightly addresson Saturday thanked the police “for their determination to bring every case stalled for decades to a just conclusion.”Show more\n\n\n\n\n\nA summary of news about Ukraine:\n"}}}],"width":120.0,"height":120.0},{"instance":{"path":"String/0.1.0","meta":{"name":"String","authors":["Evan Almloff <evanalmloff@gmail.com>"],"description":"Takes a string and returns the string","package_version":"0.1.0","binding_version":"*"},"remote":{"last_fetched":1693796532,"sha":"e10b6d735f98c45ef7c5d2aece00228e5ea593d1","repo":{"owner":"floneum","name":"floneum"},"structure":{"name":"String","authors":["Evan Almloff <evanalmloff@gmail.com>"],"description":"Takes a string and returns the string","package_version":"0.1.0","binding_version":"*"}}},"id":7,"position":[777.0,133.0],"inputs":[{"definition":{"name":" the string","ty":{"Single":"Text"}},"value":[{"Single":{"Text":"The most recent articles about Ukraine:\n{}\n\nA summary of news about Ukraine:\n"}}]}],"outputs":[{"definition":{"name":"output","ty":{"Single":"Text"}},"value":{"Single":{"Text":"The most recent articles about Ukraine:\n{}\n\nA summary of news about Ukraine:\n"}}}],"width":120.0,"height":120.0}],"node_holes":[],"edge_property":"directed","edges":[[0,1,{"start":0,"end":{"index":1,"ty":{"Element":0}}}],[1,2,{"start":0,"end":{"index":1,"ty":"Single"}}],[3,4,{"start":0,"end":{"index":1,"ty":"Single"}}],[4,2,{"start":0,"end":{"index":0,"ty":"Single"}}],[7,6,{"start":0,"end":{"index":0,"ty":"Single"}}],[2,6,{"start":0,"end":{"index":1,"ty":{"Element":0}}}],[6,5,{"start":0,"end":{"index":1,"ty":"Single"}}]]},"currently_dragging":null,"pan_pos":[0.0,0.0],"zoom":1.0}}}
