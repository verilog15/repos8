Contributing to Quod Libet
--------------------------

When raising a new issue:
 1. Decide whether it's a bug or a feature request, and choose the appropriate template
 1. Check the existing issues. It's easier for everyone to continue an existing discussion than restarting again.
 1. Fill in the appropriate template as described there

If you have related ideas, please file them separately and mention
the issue numbers of previous ideas.
