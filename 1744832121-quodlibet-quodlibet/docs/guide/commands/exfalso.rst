OPTIONS
=======

Ex Falso may be given a directory to open on the command line.

TIED TAGS
=========

Many places in Ex Falso allow you to use "tied tags". Tied tags are two tag
names joined together with a "~" like "title~version" or "album~part". Tied
tags result in "nice" displays even when one of the tags is missing; for
example, "title~version" will result in Title - Version when a version tag
is present, but only Title when one isn't. You can tie any number of tags
together.

RENAMING FILES
==============

Ex Falso allows you to rename files based on their tags. In some cases you 
may wish to alter the filename depending on whether some tags are present 
or missing, in addition to their values. A common pattern might be

``<tracknumber>. <title~version>``

You can use a '|' to only insert text when a tag is present:

``<tracknumber|<tracknumber>. ><title~version>``

You can also specify literal text to use if the tag is missing by adding
another '|':

``<album|<album>|No Album> - <title>``
