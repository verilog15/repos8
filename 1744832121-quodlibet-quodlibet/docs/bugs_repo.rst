We use the GitHub bug tracker:

* Create a new issue: https://github.com/quodlibet/quodlibet/issues/new/choose

----------------------

Quod Libet uses `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_ for source
control and is hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_:

https://github.com/quodlibet/quodlibet


.. _RunFromSource:

**Running from Source** (no installation is needed) **:**

::

    $ git clone https://github.com/quodlibet/quodlibet.git
    $ cd quodlibet
    $ ./quodlibet/quodlibet.py

To get all the dependencies needed for running Quod Libet the easiest way is 
to use one of the unstable PPAs / repos listed on the :ref:`download page 
<Downloads>`. They pull in or contain all the needed dependencies for the 
latest code and are kept up to date.
