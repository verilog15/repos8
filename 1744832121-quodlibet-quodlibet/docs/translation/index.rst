Translation Guide
=================

If you're fluent in a language other than English, and have some spare
time, you can help us translate Quod Libet. Translation is a continuous
process on an active projects like this - as developers add new features or
modify existing text used, new translations will be needed.

Of course, there might be mistakes in the English, too! Please let us know
if you find them.

Getting Started
---------------

We use `Weblate <https://weblate.org>`__ for translations which means you need to:

* Create an account on https://hosted.weblate.org
* Visit https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/quodlibet and start translating
* Any translation changes on Weblate will automatically be merged back into our
  code base after some time
* Similarly any code changes that result in changed or new source strings will
  periodically be pushed to Weblate so you can start translating them.

If you have any questions regarding the process see https://docs.weblate.org for
Weblate related information, our :any:`FAQ <faq>`, or ask us on :any:`Discord
<Contact>`.

Although not recommended, you can also translate without Weblate on your local
computer, see :any:`howto_manual` for more information.
