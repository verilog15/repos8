Contact
=======

It's easy to find the email addresses of Quod Libet's authors and 
maintainers, but please don't email us directly unless asked to, or if it 
concerns us specifically. If you contact just us, it means no one else can 
help you, and we can be really bad about replying to email.

If you have a question or want to report a bug please `open a new issue
<https://github.com/quodlibet/quodlibet/issues/new/choose>`_ on the GitHub issue
tracker. If you are not sure if your issue is a bug you can also `start a
discussion on our GitHub forum
<https://github.com/quodlibet/quodlibet/discussions>`__.

You can ask questions or just chat with us on our `Discord server
<https://discord.gg/9A4RKFEm3c>`__.

Quod Libet also has an IRC channel on `OFTC <https://www.oftc.net/>`__ ,
*#quodlibet*.
