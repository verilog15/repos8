There's an experimental **online playground** https://nitram509.github.io/lib-bpmn-engine-js/ available,
which leverages the great power of cross-compiling to WASM.

## Requirements

Go v1.23+

I'm supporting the latest and second-latest version of Go, similar to how Go itself handles releases. 

## BPMN Modelling

All these examples are build with [Camunda Modeler Community Edition](https://camunda.com/de/download/modeler/).
I would like to send a big "thank you", to Camunda for providing such tool.
