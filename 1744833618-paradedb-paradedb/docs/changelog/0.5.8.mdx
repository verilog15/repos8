## pg_analytics

- Fixed a bug where rows were reversed in SELECT statements.
- Significantly improved INSERT speeds.

## pg_search

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where `TRUNCATE` would break BM25 indexes.
- Fixed a bug where memory consumption would increase significantly when indexing large tables.
- Fixed a bug where `rank_hybrid` was not working with schemas not on the `search_path`.
- Fixed a bug where deleting Tantivy files occasionally failed.

### New Features

- Added support for query builders, which expose the entire surface area of the Tantivy API.

## pg_sparse

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where serializing/deserializing large vectors (length greater than 65536) resulted in dropped values.

## ParadeDB

### New Features

- Converted the ParadeDB base Docker image to Bitnami PostgreSQL, based on Debian 11 and Postgres 16. This has higher security guarantees, enables logical replication over heap tables, and supports `pgaudit` and `postgis`.
- Added `pg_cron` to the ParadeDB Docker image, which schedules periodic jobs in Postgres.
