## Performance Improvements ðŸš€

### Incredibly Fast Top N by Field

[#1820](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/pull/1820) introduced efficient handling of `ORDER BY <field> LIMIT` queries,
where `<field>` is indexed as a fast field. This [optimization](/documentation/full-text/sorting#fast-ordering) is automatically applied by the query planner when these queries are executed.

### `CREATE INDEX` Speedup

Introduced settings to tune the resource usage of `CREATE INDEX`, which can significantly improve index creation times by allowing
Postgres to use all of the hardware on the host machine.

### Parallel Index Scans

[#1824](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/pull/1824) introduced parallel index scans, which improves certain `COUNT(*)` queries
by 23x in local testing.

## Stability Improvements ðŸ’ª

### Index Cleanup

`0.11.0` introduced a regression where dead index files were not getting cleaned up, which caused index sizes to balloon. This has been fixed.

<Note>
  BM25 indexes created on `0.11.0` will need to be recreated for this fix to
  take effect.
</Note>

### Prepared Statements

Fixed a bug where prepared statements in the form of `field @@@ $1::text` were getting incorrectly parameterized.
