## pg_lakehouse

This release introduces our new extension, `pg_lakehouse` ðŸŽ‰

`pg_lakehouse` transforms Postgres into an analytical query engine over external object stores like S3
and table formats like Delta Lake. You can check it out [here](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/tree/dev/pg_lakehouse).

## pg_sparse

Because `pgvector` now has sparse vector support, `pg_sparse` has been deprecated. We
encourage all users to migrate to the latest version of `pgvector` for sparse vector search.

## pg_analytics

`pg_analytics` has been succeeded by `pg_lakehouse` and is now in maintenance mode. You can read more
about our rationale [here](https://github.com/paradedb/pg_analytics).

## pg_search

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where hybrid search can throw a division by zero error
- Calling `create_bm25` on an index that already exists will now throw an error instead of recreating the index
- The `key_field` argument in `create_bm25` can now be called anything, not just `id`
