## Stability Improvements ðŸ’ª

Fixed a bug introduced in `0.10.0` where support queries would throw an `ERROR: Cannot open relation with oid=Oid(0)` error.

### Deprecate PG12 Support

Now that PG12 is deprecated by the Postgres Global Development Group, `pg_search` no longer supports it.

## Performance Improvements ðŸš€

Improved the performance of `@@@` full text search predicates that return large result sets by roughly 3X.

## Documentation ðŸ“š

Added documentation for using B-tree indexes in joined search queries.
