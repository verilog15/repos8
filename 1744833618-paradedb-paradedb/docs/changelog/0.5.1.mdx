## pg_analytics

### Features

#### Introduce pg_analytics

`pg_analytics` is an extension that transforms Postgres into a very fast analytical database. Query speeds are comparable to those of dedicated OLAP databases like ClickHouse â€” without the need to leave Postgres.

Users must make the following change to their `postgresql.conf` configuration file when self-hosting. `pg_analytics` must be added to the list of `shared_preload_libraries` alongside `pg_search`:

```c
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_analytics, pg_search'
```

The easiest way to get started with `pg_analytics` is via the ParadeDB Docker image, which also comes with `pg_search`.
