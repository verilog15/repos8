## pg_search

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an out-of-bound issue when using the `snippet` functionality over fields tokenized via the ICU tokenizer.

### New Features

- Shortened query times in half in scenarios where `stable_sort = false`.
- Added a `paradedb.tokenize()` function that lists available tokenizers and can display tokens. This function is helpful for picking the right tokenizer for your use case.

- Added support for the JSON & JSONB datatypes.
- Added support for `DATE_TRUNC()` queries.
