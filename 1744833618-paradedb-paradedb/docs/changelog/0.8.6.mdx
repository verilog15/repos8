### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a cache invalidation bug affecting concurrent connections during index re-creation

### New Features

- Introduced new `paradedb.field` and `paradedb.tokenizer` functions that make it easier to configure fields in `create_bm25`. While Postgres
  `JSONB` can still be passed to `create_bm25`, JSON5 strings without double quotes around keys are no longer supported.
