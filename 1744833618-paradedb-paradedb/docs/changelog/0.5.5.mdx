## pg_analytics

### Features

This update introduces several breaking changes to `pg_analytics`. Users will need to drop and recreate `pg_analytics` in order
to upgrade. Note that this will delete all data that depends on `pg_analytics`.

```sql
DROP EXTENSION pg_analytics CASCADE;
CREATE EXTENSION pg_analytics;
```

#### New Table Access Method Name

We've renamed `deltalake` tables to `parquet` tables. This was done to avoid confusion with how we are currently using `deltalake`
-- as a library for managing local Parquet files, not as an external object store (this is coming in the future).

#### Multiple Database Compatibility

We fixed a bug where `VACUUM`ing would delete `parquet` tables in other databases.

#### Physical Backup Support

Physical backups with `pg_dump` now work over `parquet` tables.

#### Utility Statements

`COPY` and `ADD COLUMN` clauses now work over `parquet` tables.
