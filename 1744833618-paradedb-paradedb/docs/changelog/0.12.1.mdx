## New Features ðŸ”¥

### Enumerated Type Support

Custom Postgres enums can now be indexed and filtered over.

## Performance Improvements ðŸš€

### Parallelized Aggregates

ParadeDB Enterprise now has support for parallelized aggregates, which allows any query containing `@@@` and returning
fast fields to use all of the available hardware. This delivers significant performance improvements. We're seeing 5-10X faster `COUNT`s over
large result sets (100M+ rows) in our test datasets.

## Stability Improvements ðŸ’ª

- Fixed a bug where parallel index scans could return incorrect results.
