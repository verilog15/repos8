## pg_search

### Bug Fixes

- Improved the speed of search queries by over 70%, down to 200ms for warm searches on 1.18 billion rows.

### Features

- Improved the `rank_bm25` and `highlight` interfaces to avoid requiring the user to duplicate their query and JOIN a new table for every rank and highlight.
- Exposed the `prefix` and `postfix` options from Tantivy to allow the user to override the default tags used for highlighting.
- Introduced the `stable_sort` search parameter, which allows the user to enforce a deterministic search results ordering (based on key field).
