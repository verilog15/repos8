## pg_search

### Features

#### Introduce global background writer

Overhauled the process in which data is written to the index, fixing several issues related to concurrency and insert performance.

Fixes an issue with using the `prefix => ` parameter in fuzzy searches.

Users must make the following change to their `postgresql.conf` configuration file when self-hosting. `pg_search` must be added to the list of `shared_preload_libraries` so the background process can be initialized:

```c
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_search'
```
