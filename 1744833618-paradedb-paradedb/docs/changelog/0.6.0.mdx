## pg_analytics

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where memory consumption would balloon when inserting large amounts of data into a `parquet` table.
- Fixed a bug where VACUUM operations would not be performed on `parquet` tables.

### New Features

- We've added support for JOINs across `parquet` and regular Postgres heap tables.
- It is now possible to `CREATE TABLE USING parquet AS SELECT * FROM ...` to create a `parquet` table from a regular Postgres table.

## pg_search

### New Features

- We've successfully tested `pg_search` over 1 billion rows and renamed it to `pg_search`.
- We've improved the documentation for `pg_search` to make it easier to get started with the extension.

## ParadeDB

### New Features

- Users can now contact us for help directly from the ParadeDB database or from a specific ParadeDB extension via `SELECT paradedb.help(subject => $$your issue$$);`.
