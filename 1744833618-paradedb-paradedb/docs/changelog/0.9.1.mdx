## pg_search

### New Features

- Added support for `more_like_this` clause, which returns documents similar to a given document.
- Added support for querying the size, in bytes, of a BM25 index.

## pg_analytics

pg_lakehouse has been combined with pg_analytics and the joint extension was renamed to pg_analytics. This was done to
facilitate user adoption by providing a single extension for analytics.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where specifying the schema name in `CREATE FOREIGN TABLE` would fail.

## ParadeDB

### Bug Fixes

- Fix an issue where the ParadeDB Docker image would fail to start inside a CloudNativePG Kubernetes cluster.
- Fixed a bug where pg_analytics would fail to create DuckDB extensions in the ParadeDB Docker image due to missing permissions.
