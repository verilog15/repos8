## pg_analytics

### Features

- Previously, users of `pg_analytics` needed to run `CALL paradedb.init();` on every new database connection. This is no longer necessary. `pg_analytics` now automatically initializes itself on the first query.

## ParadeDB

### Features

- The ParadeDB Docker image now ships with PostgreSQL 16.
- We have removed third-party PostgreSQL extensions from the ParadeDB Docker image, reducing the image size significantly. If you would like a specific third-party PostgreSQL extension supported on ParadeDB, please contact us at [hello@paradedb.com](mailto:hello@paradedb.com).
