## Synchronous Replication

By default, ParadeDB ships with asynchronuous replication, meaning transactions on the primary **do not** wait for confirmation from
the standby instances before committing.

**Quorum-based synchronous replication** ensures that a transaction is successfully written to standbys before it completes.
Please consult the [CloudNativePG Replication documentation](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.18/replication/#synchronous-replication) for details.

## Backup and Disaster Recovery

ParadeDB supports backups to cloud object stores (e.g. S3, GCS, etc.) and point-in-time-recovery
via [Barman](https://pgbarman.org/). To configure the frequency and location of backups, please consult the [CloudNativePG Backup documentation](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.18/backup_recovery/).
